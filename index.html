            <p>"I desire, Tom," cried Miss Branghton, "you'd speak for yourself, and not make so free with my name."</p>

            <p>"There, now, she's up! There's nothing but quarrelling with the women; it's my belief they like it better than victuals and drink."</p>
            
            <p>"Fie, Tom," cried Mr. Smith, "you never remember your manners before the ladies: I'm sure you never heard me speak so rude to them."</p>
            
            <p>"Why, Lord, you are a beau; but that's nothing to me. So, if you've a mind, you may be so polite as to dance with aunt yourself." Then, with a loud laugh, he declared it would be good fun to see them.</p>
            
            <p>"Let it be never so good, or never so bad," cried Madame Duval, "you won't see nothing of it, I promise you; so pray don't let me hear no more of such vulgar pieces of fun; for, I assure you, I don't like it. And as to my dancing with Mr. Smith, you may see wonderfuller things than that any day in the week."</p>
            
            <p>"Why, as to that, Ma'am," said Mr. Smith, looking much surprised, "I always thought you intended to play at cards, and so I thought to dance with the young lady."</p>
            
            <p>I gladly seized this opportunity to make my declaration, that I should not dance at all.</p>
            
            <p>"Not dance at all!" repeated Miss Branghton; "yes, that's a likely matter truly, when people go to balls."</p>
            
            <p>"I wish she mayn't," said the brother; "'cause then Mr. Smith will have nobody but aunt for a partner. Lord, how mad he'll be!"</p>
            
            <p>"O, as to that," said Mr. Smith, "I don't at all fear of prevailing with the young lady, if once I get her to the room."</p>
            
            <p>"Indeed, Sir," cried I, much offended by his conceit, "you are mistaken; and therefore I beg leave to undeceive you, as you may be assured my resolution will not alter."</p></div>
